## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I tend to over complicate things, but it's usually solved by removing some hard-coded widths and heights. This challenge made me realise I don't fully grasp how images are being displayed in the browser.

### Continued development

Focus on making more card designs in different orientations and sizes to get a solid understanding of the box model, flex and images. Add dark mode button.
